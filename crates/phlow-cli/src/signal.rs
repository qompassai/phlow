//! SIGTERM handling, mirroring `flow/main.py`.
//!
//! Python installs a `SIGTERM` handler that raises `KeyboardInterrupt`,
//! unwinding the command (including the `serve` loop) so `main` prints
//! `Phlow interrupted; changes already written are not rolled back.` and
//! exits 130. This module reproduces the observable contract — the message
//! on stderr and exit code 130 — with a dedicated watcher thread: the
//! thread owns signal delivery, the main thread owns the runtime, and the
//! process exits promptly on delivery. Cleanup beyond process exit is moot
//! (the OS reclaims every handle), which is exactly what Python's message
//! documents: already-written changes are *not* rolled back.
//!
//! The watcher is unix-only, mirroring Python's
//! `if hasattr(signal, "SIGTERM")` guard.

/// Exit code for keyboard/signal interruption, matching Python's
/// `except KeyboardInterrupt: return 130`.
