//! Named, operator-approved checks for the phlow agent runtime.
//!
//! A [`CheckRunner`](runner::CheckRunner) executes the exact argv from the
//! operator's TOML — no shell, no model-chosen command, cwd, or
//! environment. Each check runs to completion or its configured timeout;
//! on timeout the whole process group is killed and reaped, so no orphan
//! keeps running after the report. Each program is pinned by canonical
//! path and SHA-256 at admission ([`pin`]) and re-verified before spawn.
//!
//! The legacy `shell_exec` and `lsp_check` tools are fail-closed here:
//! [`disabled`] preserves their exact denial behavior as typed values,
//! never as silently skipped execution.
