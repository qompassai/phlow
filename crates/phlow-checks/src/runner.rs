//! The named-check runner: exact argv, bounded output, deadline kills.
//!
//! [`CheckRunner`] executes one operator-approved check at a time. The
//! child always starts in its own process group (`process_group(0)`, a safe
//! std wrapper — no `unsafe` in this crate), with the workspace as its cwd,
//! a private per-run scratch directory as its `TMPDIR` (Unix), the
//! `phlow-seccomp` egress filter installed (Linux), stdin closed, and
//! stdout/stderr captured through bounded tail buffers.
//! On timeout the whole process group is killed and reaped, so a check can
//! never outlive its report as an orphan.
//!
//! Sync only: the async Tokio executor arrives in Phase 4. Deadlines are
//! enforced by polling, which keeps every wait bounded and reaping exact.
